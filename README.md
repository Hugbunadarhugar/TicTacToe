# TicTacToe
[This is an implementation of TicTacToe made by Hugbúnaðarhugar.](https://hugbunadarhugar.herokuapp.com/)
## Introduction
This project was made for the course SC-T-303 Software Engineering at Reykjavík University. The assignment was to implement the well-known game of Tic Tac Toe using coding practices that have been taught throughout the course. The game itself is intended for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game If neither player is able to achieve this goal and there are no more empty spaces on the game board, the game results in a draw.
